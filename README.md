# Portfolio Website

After completion of my Software Engineering Immersive Program, I decided to create my very own portfolio website using React. This portfolio website will include any/all materials needed by Recruiters, Hiring Managers, and/or fellow engineers/developers. As with all of my applications, this is mobile friendly so feel free to enjoy this on a computer, tablet, or phone.
